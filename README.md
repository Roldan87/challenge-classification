## Challenge Bearing Classification

# Description
  This was an assignment we received during our training at BeCode.  
  The main goal was to get used to Machine Learning, specifically using classification algorithms.   
  For this we used a database from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/isaienkov/bearing-classification" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, on testing bearings.  
  Our job was to predict if a bearing was defective or not, with an accuracy as high as possible.
